    //A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed. Generally,

    // Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the programâ€™s execution. At this point, when the main thread is provided,
    // the main() method is invoked by the main thread.
    //
    //A thread is critical in the program because it enables multiple operations to take place within a single method.
    // Each thread in the program often has its own program counter, stack, and local variable.

    //There are two-way to create threads
    //by extends the Thread class
    //by implementing Runnable interface
