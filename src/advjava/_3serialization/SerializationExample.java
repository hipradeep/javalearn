    //Serialization in Java is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte-stream.
    //The reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization where byte-stream is converted into an object.
    //The serialization and deserialization process is platform-independent,
    // it means you can serialize an object on one platform and deserialize it on a different platform.
